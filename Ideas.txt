1) Halloween app:

	TreatPro (or something): using streetview (maybe) and recognition software capable of 
determining whether Halloween is "on" at a given location, return to users the highest local 
density of potential scores :)

	To define/issues: how local(?); 
		recognition possible(?); 
		will google allow free 'pulls'
	of streetview sufficient to develop the density metric, and further is software capable
	of this(IF orange light OR pumpkin, 1; ELSE 0)

2) PrepCoach (or something): Given a mobile scanner, voice recognition software and (is it possble
	to dictate complete/incomplete status that Siri-type entity can then alter a list, read
	off next task); 

	To define/issues: a lot of kinks/unknowns in this one, but could be of great benefit
	to labor intensive/hands-busy work
