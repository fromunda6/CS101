Python Methods learned thus far (a living reference):

	# create and assign a value to a variable
	var_name = constant, function, range, series, (...anything?)

	# return a character in position[#] from variable theta
	theta[0]
	# ret_Char from position[#] to the end of vari
	vari[0:]
	# ret_Char before position[#]
	var_name[:5]

	# find and return the position of a substring in a string, with optional param = position at which to start searching
	var_name.find("certain string", 4)
	sea
	# display a variable in ui
	print (var_name)

	# define a procedure
	def proc_name(input1, input2):
		task1 = var_name.find("certain string")
		task2 = task1[2:4]
		return output1, output2 #must be something computed by the procedure, i.e. task1, task2

Python Color-Coding:

# 1). recognized non-string datatypes (numbers and boolean values, maybe othere(?)) are in purple:

	3, 2500, True, False #boolean values are only recognized in uppercase

# 2). strings, besides the obvious '' and "" identifiers, will always show up in

	"pale yellow"
