print (60*24*7*7)

# how far, in cm, does light travel in one nansecond?
print ((299792458*100)/1000000000)

# variable assignment example
speed_of_light = 299792458 # meters per second
billionth = 1.0/1000000000
nanostick = speed_of_light * billionth * 100
print (nanostick)
cycles_per_second = 2700000000 # or 2.7ghz

# ? How far does light travel, in metres, in a single computer cycle?
